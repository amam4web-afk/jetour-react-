        <h4>2. What third-party services do we use?</h4>
        <p>On our websites, we incorporate social plugins from popular social networks like Instagram, Facebook, X, and YouTube. Here’s how they work:</p>
        <p><i class="dot"></i> When you visit our websites, social media plugins are initially deactivated. This means
          no
          information is
          transmitted to the network operators. If you want to use any of these networks, simply click on the respective
          plugin to establish a direct connection to their servers.</p>

        <p><i class="dot"></i> If you’re logged into your user account on a social network when you activate the plugin,
          the network can
          recognize your visit to our websites and associate it with your account. To prevent this, please log out of
          the network before activating the social plugin. The social network cannot detect your visits to other
          websites of ours unless you activate its social plugin on those sites too.</p>

        <p><i class="dot"></i> When you activate a social plugin, the network directly transfers the available content
          to
          your browser,
          which integrates it into our websites. During this process, data transfers controlled by the respective social
          network may occur. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers between the network and your
          system, and your interactions on the platform are governed solely by the network’s data protection provisions.
        </p>
        <p><i class="dot"></i> The social plugin remains active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies. For more
          information about
          cookies setting, please read our <a href="../cookie/index.htm">Cookies Notice</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that our website may feature links to external websites beyond our control, and this Privacy
          Policy does not apply to them. If you access these websites through the provided links, the operators of those
          websites may collect information from you according to their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours.
        </p>

        <h4>3. With whom will we share this data?</h4>
        <h5>3.1 Affiliates and subsidiaries</h5>
        <p>To assist, operate, enhance, and fulfil services on our behalf based on our legitimate interests to outsource

          enforcement authority, we assess the necessity and proportionality of the requested information.</p>

These legitimate interests may include JETOUR’s interest in improving its products and services, enhancing safety and security, protecting JETOUR or its business partners against wrongful conduct, and responding to customer inquiries and claims. Where applicable, we will inform you whether and why we need certain information from you, for example, whether we need the information to fulfill a legal or contractual requirement and what the consequences are of not providing the information.</p>
