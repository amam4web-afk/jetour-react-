							<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Cheetahs, the world&#39;s fastest land animals, are beloved worldwide. However, few people are aware that their wild population is rapidly declining with less than 7,500 individuals remaining. Studies show that cheetahs&#39; current habitat has shrunk by 91% compared to historical levels, primarily due to habitat loss, human wildlife conflict and illegal wildlife trade. Now cheetahs are only found in a few countries with population strong-holds in southern Africa, Namibia and Botswana, and East Africa, Kenya and Tanzania. Two thirds of the remaining populations are less than 100 individuals and are on the brink of extinction. Namibia is known as the Cheetah Capital of the World.<br><br></span></p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="../data/en/upload/images/202409/17270800303349.jpg" title="17270800303349.jpg" alt="20240923020001.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In its global development, JETOUR adheres to its &quot;Travel+&quot; strategy, focusing on regional economic development and conserving the natural and cultural environments related to travel. During the collaboration with Discovery Channel earlier this year, JETOUR visited Namibia and learned about the dire situation of cheetahs in Africa. Realizing the urgency of wildlife protection, JETOUR actively sought opportunities to participate in cheetah conservation.</span></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Partnering with CCF: Stepping in Cheetah Conservation</span></strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Founded in Namibia in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) has been at the forefront of global cheetah conservation. Led by Dr. Laurie Marker, CCF is a world leader in cheetah research and conservation. JETOUR began discussions with Dr. Marker in April and quickly cooperated on the global cheetah conservation initiative.</span></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On 20 September 2024, JETOUR officially announced its strategic partnership with CCF at the launch event in South Africa. To support CCF, JETOUR will support the annual care of two orphan/non-releasable cheetahs and donate official vehicles in improving cheetah habitats. JETOUR will also work with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on cheetah conservation and promote the &quot;Protect the Cheetah&quot; initiative worldwide. This campaign aims to raise public awareness and encourage participation in cheetah conservation.</span><br><br></a></p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="../data/en/upload/images/202409/17270800991512.jpg" title="17270800991512.jpg" alt="2024092302002.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Dr. Laurie Marker, CCF’s Founder and&nbsp;Executive Director, stated, &quot;Cheetah conservation requires long-term commitment, and JETOUR, with its dedication to long-term goals, is a perfect partner.
